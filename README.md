**Spend Guide - Privacy Policy**

Last Updated: November 2025

App Name: Spend Guide

Developer: Şifreli Ders


**1. Overview**

Spend Guide is a personal expense tracking app that works completely offline.
The app does not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal data to external servers.
All information entered by the user is stored only on the user’s device and never leaves it.

**2. Data Collection and Storage**

The app does not require registration or user login.

The app does not collect:

Personal information (name, email, phone, etc.)

Financial data or bank details

Device identifiers or analytics data

Location, contacts, or media access

All data you enter (such as expenses, categories, or notes) is stored locally on your device using secure local storage (AsyncStorage).
This data is not uploaded, shared, or used for any external purpose.

**3. Local Data Handling**

All expense records, settings, and preferences are saved only on your phone.
If you delete the app or clear its data, all information will be permanently lost.
The app does not maintain any backup or cloud synchronization.

You may optionally export your data manually (as JSON file) to keep a personal backup.
These exported files remain fully under your control and are never uploaded by the app.

**4. Security**

Spend Guide uses biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, or fingerprint) to add an extra layer of security.
This feature only authenticates locally on your device using the system’s secure APIs — no biometric data is stored or transmitted by the app.

**5. Permissions**

Spend Guide requests only minimal permissions necessary for its offline operation:

Storage access: to export or import local data files

No other device permissions (camera, contacts, location, etc.) are required or used.

**6. Data Sharing**

❌ No data is sent to any external server

❌ No data is shared with third parties

❌ No analytics or tracking tools are integrated

❌ No advertising SDKs are used

Your data remains 100% private and offline.

**7. User Rights**

Since Spend Guide does not collect or store any personal information, there is no data to access, modify, or delete on our servers.
If you wish to remove your local data, you can:

Use the “Clear Data” option within the app settings, or

Uninstall the app to permanently delete all data stored on your device.

**8. Contact**
